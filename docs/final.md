## Project Summary
The focus of our project is to design and implement a learning algorithm that trains an agent to collaborate with another (human or non-human) agent to catch a pig in Minecraft according to the rules of [The Malmo Collaborative AI Challenge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/collaborative-ai-challenge/# "Challenge Homepage").

We have defined our baseline agent to be one that uses A* to determine the shortest distance to aid in capturing the pig. We aim to improve our baseline by using well known techniques in reinforcment learning, machine learning, and classical artificial intelligence.
