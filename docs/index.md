#### A [Sandhog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandhog) is a slang term given to urban miners, constrution workers who work underground on a variety of excavation projects in New York City. ####

#### Like the Sandhogs of New York City working deep underground, our AI project employs a deep Q network that works layers deep to determine the best actions our agents can make in Minecraft's pig chase challenge. ####
